Q1. What is the difference between partitioned and global multi-processor scheduling? What are the
pros and cons of each?

Partitioned multi-processor scheduling statically binds each task to a single processor. Because each task is predictably bound, it is an ideal candidate for hard real-time systems that need guaranteed deadlines and simple analysis. One major drawback is that it can easily lead to processor imbalance if the tasks aren't distributed in a near-optimal way.

Global multi-processor scheduling holds a global queue from which any processor can run a task. This improves the overall load balancing issues from partitioned scheduling, but introduces higher runtime overhead from context switching and migration.


Q2. Explain your task partitioning strategy. List which tasks you assigned to Core 0 and Core 1, and
show that the utilization on each core is <= 1.0



Q3. Please measure the overhead of your EDF scheduling implementation in the Kernel space? Was it
acceptable?



Q4. How did you implement the e2e latency measurement? Specifically, where in the kernel are the
start and end times captured, and how did you handle synchronization between cores?



Q5. What issues did you face for this project and how did you resolve them?
